This is an example terraform script
running this script would take alot of time and cost due to the amount of resources(10,000) that need to be set up in GCP
As per my knowledge it is recommended to create resources as needed using TF
In line 11, replace credentials with GCP json file path


Commands to run in the directory with tf file:
$terraform init
$terraform validate
$terraform apply
$terraform destroy
